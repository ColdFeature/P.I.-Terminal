<h2><span>&raquo;About</span></h2>
<p>Date: 20th February 2026
Subject: SPECIMEN 2.4

Field Team Leader,

Specimen 2.4 was last documented during the Alpheros-Class Security Anomaly; responsible for the anarchy that ensued, namely the escape of all Novaraptors in captivity. With incredible foresight, coordination and collaboration Specimen 2.4 has successfully evaded our grasp and has eluded us ever since.

Alpheros - a cataclysm that has gone without any form of accountability or liability for any parties involved. I refuse to believe that it was the mere deception of an animal that we created. It simply could not have occurred without inside intervention - which as we have established prior is not something unheard of.

In any case: the few observations made with reference to Specimen 2.4 suggest atypical intellect, strength and 'influence'. Of course, studies have made evident the existence of 'alphas' in a pack of Novaraptors - but a leader of the entire species seems outright unrealistic. So, it is my firm and unfaltering belief that we must track down and subdue Specimen 2.4 "Ruvik" for meticulous study and scrutiny, good luck.</p>

<section id="usage">
<h2><span>&raquo;Usage</span></h2>
<p>Using it is pretty straight forward. Create several(as much as you need) divs or &laquo;section&raquo; elements each with it's unique id to hold your content. Make sure to have an error section (id="error") with some information to warn the user when he/she mistypes a command or if there is no section with that name, think of it as a 404 page.</p>
<p>A section with id="help" is also required so you can list all the available sections and let your users know what words to write to access that particular content.</p>
<p>The input field must be a standalone element and must not be placed inside any of the content divs or sections, and make sure you give it a classname "command", if you want to name it anything else you need to edit the app.js and change all instances of .command in the script to match your chosen classname.</p>
<p>In short, just view the source code of this demo, copy/modify it to your liking making sure you include the error and help sections.</p>
