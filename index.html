<h2><span>&raquo;Report A24-1</span></h2>
<p>Date: 20th February 2026</p>
<p>Subject: SPECIMEN 2.4</p>

<p>Field Team Leader,</p>

<p>Specimen 2.4 was last documented during the Alpheros-Class Security Anomaly; responsible for the anarchy that ensued, namely the escape of all Novaraptors in captivity. With incredible foresight, coordination and collaboration Specimen 2.4 has successfully evaded our grasp and has eluded us ever since.</p>

<p>Alpheros - a cataclysm that has gone without any form of accountability or liability for any parties involved. I refuse to believe that it was the mere deception of an animal that we created. It simply could not have occurred without inside intervention - which as we have established prior is not something unheard of.</p>

<p>In any case: the few observations made with reference to Specimen 2.4 suggest atypical intellect, strength and 'influence'. Of course, studies have made evident the existence of 'alphas' in a pack of Novaraptors - but a leader of the entire species seems outright unrealistic. So, it is my firm and unfaltering belief that we must track down and subdue Specimen 2.4 "Ruvik" for meticulous study and scrutiny, good luck.</p>

<p>Date: 1st June 2026</p>
<p>Subject: SPECIMEN 1.6 DISPATCH</p>

<p>Field Team Leader,</p>

<p>Your work tracking Specimen 2.4 has been nothing but outstanding considering the circumstances of the recent geothermal plant destruction. However, I am assigning you to a different task, Specimen 1.6 is of the upmost importance now. I've sent over the best equipment from the previous team who attempted containing the beast. The research teams have concluded their mission, we now have a full picture of what happened, damn Luton.</p> 

<p>I'm giving you time to prepare before you are sent out. From what we have found in the computer logs Specimen 1.6 is far more dangerous than we anticipated. Read the report on Specimen 1.6, learn your target as it will be the hardest thing your team has done yet, good luck.</p>

<p>Subject: PROJECT GEMINI</p>

<p>Dr. Holden, </p>

<p>Congratulations, you've done it again you fucking maniac; you just had to! Has the the small rat sized turd inside your hollow skull not learned anything at all? Seriously, how many god damn times has your lab created something so incredibly dangerous just to lose it to the depths of the island. Thank god this won't be another 1.6, at least one benefit came out of you making it so absurdly intelligent despite the need to control them. Your inability to properly conduct a project will be discussed later; right now this needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>I don't even know where to tell you to start; from the reports I've received there isn't much evidence of where they went. This damn geothermal incident is fucking up everything. They could be dead in the sealed tunnels for all we know. Regardless, we don't have the funds to restart this project. Get your damn assets if its the last thing you do, because if you don't I'll have you sent back to the small science lab I found you in.</p>

<h2><span>&raquo;Report A16-2</span></h2>
<p>Date: 6th July 2026</p>
<p>Subject: SPECIMEN 1.6 REPORT</p>

<p>HQ Command,</p>

<p>Asset mortality rates are on the climb again. Ranger patrols found a kill site with multiple terminated herbivores and one terminated medium carnivore. The kills seemed fresh and a couple of them hadn't been touched, suggesting that the attacks happened in rapid succession. </p>

<p>We need help, Specimen 1.6 is too fast and durable for anything short of a concentrated assault. Like the Field Team Leader before me, I sincerely request that we get the green light to blow this thing to hell; the effort of trying to apprehend it isn't worth the continued damage it causes to the ecosystem. </p>

<p>We managed to track it and chase it across the reserve towards the eastern jungle where it slipped into hiding, though I expect the odds to turn when this thing recovers from the bullets we just plugged it with. It'll definitely show itself again once it's licked its wounds. That thing doesn't give up easily.</p>

<p>Date: 1st September 2026</p>
<p>Subject: GEMINI ASSETS</p> 

<p>HQ Command,</p>

<p>Dr. Holden has been declared missing. After a few months of searching for the assets the recovery team noticed changes in his behavior. He slowly drifted away from the team, preferring to work alone. It's been three days since we were supposed to see him and no one can find him. We believe he found the whereabouts of the 'Twins' prior to his disappearance. It is unclear where he might've gone. He is either still on the island or left on last night's cargo ship. We are looking for any clues of what he found; his work is lying around somewhere. The team awaits your instructions - in the mean time we will continue the search.</p>

<h2><span>&raquo;Report Gemini-3</span></h2>
<p>Date: 27th October 2026</p>
<p>Subject: GEMINI INVESTIGATION</p> 

<p>HQ Command,</p>

<p>The investigation has been concluded; our findings are peculiar to say the least. Dr. Holden was seen leaving the New Eden installation in the early morning of August 28th escorted by armed units. They left via the docks, where they had their boat waiting. We cannot identify who took him, nor if he went willingly. To put it mildly, the security team on guard that night needs to be let go.</p>

<p>The good news is that, after reviewing Dr. Holden's notes, we located the Twins. We were able to document them, but ultimately they evaded most of our attempts to capture and escaped containment when we did contain them. The scientific team is requesting an update on the specialized containment for them, and the rest of the extremely modified assets. Until then we will continue to monitor the GEMINI assets on the Reserve.</p>

<p>Among Dr. Holden's notes we found the behavioral analysis. Most of it is just blabber about how great his creation is, though there are some useful parts we picked out. He codenamed the assets 'Akula' and 'Avalon' and noted their unique bond with one another. The notes say they would go to the point of death to protect the other. He also mentions their differences in behavior, detailing that 'Akula' is the most aggressive and prone to violence and confrontations but not considered the Alpha. 'Avalon' is relatively passive and prone to avoid fighting if possible. These distinctions could prove useful to tell them apart, as there is no physical variation between the two.</p>

<p>These are just the main findings of the report. The full document will be sent to you shortly, and we await our next assignments.</p>

<h2><span>&raquo;Report Geothermal-1</span></h2>
<p>Date: 27th October 2026</p>
<p>Subject: GEOTHERMAL INCIDENT INVESTIGATION</p> 

<p>Engineering Supervisor,</p>

<p>We got the lay of the land out here, finally. Them scientists and their guards wouldn't let us touch this place, aside for when we needed to test the tunnel supports. We've been looking around for quite some time and running tests. Our professional opinion is that the entire incident was caused by overload of the drill. Someone must've intentionally set the thing to destroy itself. I'm sure I'll have to write thousands of pages to prove this to those suits, but it is what it is. </p>

<p>The site itself is completely unusable. The damage is too extensive and with the new inhabitants I've heard about lurking in the tunnels we couldn't repair it safely even if we wanted to. The supports are fine for now, though we are concerned they won't hold up against the rising lava levels. The camera recordings are also destroyed, the rocks constantly shift and the heat is unbearable due to the broken controls. It's best we leave this place alone, any type of building here is a horrible idea. </p>

<p>We pack up and leave later today. You owe me a trip to Hawaii when I get back.</p>

<h2><span>&raquo;Report A23-1</span></h2>
<p>Date: 27th October 2026</p>
<p>Subject: MESSAGE TO DR. VEGA</p> 

<p>Dr. Vega,</p>

<p>I've received news that a total of four assets from project Apollo have been successfully terminated. Though the casualties and damages these assets have caused will not be an issue we take lightly. The third search and rescue mission brought back a young Brandon Ritchie. The poor kid was horribly traumatized after watching one of your assets mutilate his friends. </p>

<p>Do you want to know what he told our medical staff? "It told me to leave.". Impressive, absolutely impressive. You're an untapped talent, Vega. But even after everything we've seen, these assets are simply not viable. We already have a highly intelligent species capable of complex communication and coordination. Project CAU puts project Apollo to shame. As your senior, I can't make excuses for you. Get your act together and produce an asset we can use efficiently or I will have no other choice but to let you go. </p>

<p>From, Dr. Chance. </p>
